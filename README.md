=========

Collection of pi based motion detection things.

You will need a raspberry pi with camera module http://amzn.to/1C0GUde

Check out the install.sh script, those are the steps I follow to get a fresh raspberry pi with camera module generating a motion detecting security camera web page.

There's a [github page](http://pauly.github.io/pi-motion/) for this showing a demo.
